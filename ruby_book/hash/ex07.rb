NoMethodError: undefined method `keys' for Array
A. We're missing keys in an array variable.

B. There is no method called keys for Array objects.

C. keys is an Array object, but it hasn't been defined yet.

D. There's an array of strings, and we're trying to get the string keys out of the array, but it doesn't exist.

My answer: B. 
I felt the error was a built in response
specfically for built in methods. I interpretedt it meant
there is no built in method 'keys' for the Array type.
So I googled to see if there was a 'keys' method for Arrays.
I didn' think so because it would not make sense because Arrays
don't have keys. I was correct there is no keys method for arrays.
