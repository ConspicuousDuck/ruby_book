Look at the following programs...

Copy Code
x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x
and...

Copy Code
y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x
What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?

=begin 
What does x print to the screen in each case?
  1st case: '3' is printed to the screen.
  2nd case: Error has occured.

Do they both give errors? 
  No. Only the second case gives an error.

Are the errors different? Why?
  There is only one error. There is no other error to compare one another.

Why did case 2 get an error?
  Case 2 got an error because 'x' is not defined. The 'x' you see in the code
  is inside a block. A block's scope can modify things outside of it, but things
  outside of it (the block) cannot be reached. You can go out, but can't go in.
  So 'puts x', returns an error because 'x' is not defined in it's own scope.
  It does not exist. We cannot reach the 'x' inside the block.
